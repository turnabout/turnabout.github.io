Hi! I’m a full-stack software developer with over 10 years of experience. I love creating meaningful solutions that make a difference for people and add real value.

I currently work at Ubisoft as a backend engineer, where I lead the development of a critical user-facing API powering clients in Ubisoft’s e-commerce ecosystem.

Feel free to get in touch! I’m always happy to connect. All relevant links are at the top of the page.
