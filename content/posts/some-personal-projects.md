Here is an overview of some personal projects I've worked on over the years. Some are finished, others not so much. :)

## Flappy Birdy

{{< inlinetags JavaScript GameDev >}}

Very basic flappy bird clone made using JavaScript and the Canvas API. This is one of the oldest projects I've worked on, originally made sometime in 2014. It had issues but it worked! It makes me appreciate how much I've learned over the years.

Back then, I was still pushing files to an FTP server directly by drag-dropping them via FileZilla. I had never even heard of Git. The only way I knew to do version control was by making a copy of my project and rename it to something like `project_2014_04_18`.
