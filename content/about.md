Hi! I'm Kevin. I've been into programming for about 8 years. I'm mostly self-taught and I started off by making WordPress websites for a small web agency.

Right now, I'm working as a web developer for <a href="https://www.flighthub.com" target="_blank">FlightHub</a>, an online travel agency. I am mostly focused on writing frontend code, but I often find myself doing backend as well.

I love spending time on personal projects outside of that, too. Check out [my post]({{< relref "posts/some-personal-projects" >}}) detailing some of those.

Some languages/technologies I'm familiar with and enjoy using include Typescript, React, SCSS, WebAssembly, Golang and C.
