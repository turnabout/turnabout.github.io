Hi! I'm Kevin. I've been into programming for about 8 years. I'm mostly self-taught and I started off by making WordPress websites for a small web agency.

Right now, I'm working as an IT web developer for Ubisoft.

I love spending time on personal projects outside of that, too. Check out [my post]({{< relref "posts/some-personal-projects" >}}) detailing some of those.

Some languages/technologies I'm familiar with and enjoy using include Go, C, Typescript, React and WebAssembly.
